# PMSPro

This is the source code for our UVM Spring 2006 Software Project Management course.  This was a group project, with me as the lead.  

PMSPro is a software project management system.  The key features are:

  1. OpenGL-based viewer.  This gives it a high-speed 60fps interface.
  2. Remote database connection.  You can save tasks in a shared remote database for all members of the project to veiw.
  3. Cross-platform.  This was developed with the Qt framework, and was compiled for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

I haven't touched this code at all since 2006, but it's provided as-is. I don't remember if it's usable.
